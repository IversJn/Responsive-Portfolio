                Hello my name is Jacob Ivers, I am a recent graduate from James Madison University. I was a major in Organizational Communications Studies as well as having a minor in Computer Information Systems. After having an internship at Synopsys Intergrity Software for the past two years I have decided I have great interest in Web Application Software. This interest prompted me to enroll in a 12 week Full Stack Development Bootcamp at George Washington University. I have expereince in Python, SQL, and Java but decided with to learn more by enrolling in Bootcamp Program.
